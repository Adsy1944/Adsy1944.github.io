          <h4>4 October 2020 - Sorry it's been a while</h4>
          Hello again campers, I've probably already lost all of your attention already, for that I apologise. Between
          a baby, an apprenticeship, a rudendancy, new job and a stay in hospital I'm afraid this blog has been somewhat
          neglected during lockdown.
          <br/>
          I want to start at the beginning, as this was the purpose of this blog, but I think I owe you a brief explanation
          of where I am right now. During the lockdown I was placed of furlough at the very end of my apprenticeship, and
          then made redundant. My management team have been very supportive and I have managed to complete my studies
          and am just waiting for a final interview before my certificate is released. I have now found a new job with
          the local fire service, however a few days ago I collapsed, and have been in hospital ever since. This is a
          massive blow and couldn't have come at a worse time. I'm hoping to use some of my time in hospital to bring
          you all up to speed on my journey this far, as I'm really not up to doing much else.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I want to quickly touch on the web apps that I mentiioned in my previous blog. I haven't made any changes since
          releasing these as I've been working on a much more interesting project, which I will show you in due course.
          however I need to point out that the third party data source as ceased working correctly and as a result I no
          longer receive the required data to show all the figures on screen. The NHS have now released their own API,
          so I will at some point go back and make the relevant changes, as it's becoming clear that COVID isn't going
          away any time soon.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          That's all for today, but I'll be back tomorrow.

          <h4>9 June 2020 - Welcome to Adsy's Corner</h4>
          Hi and welcome to the first issue of my blog. Im a software developer at the end of my apprenticeship, and I thought that I might share my story as it's been quite interesting.
          I hope that it will provide some visibility into getting into code, and possibly help those that are thinking about making the first few steps.
          I built this website to help me practise my web building, and as I get time (once my apprenticeship is over) I may even make some applications that require Java and
          databases to practise my other other software development skills. At the time of this issue, the website currently hosts 2 web applications. COVID19, which is a complete application that
          receives daily case and death data for the coronavirues and displays it in a basic dashboard to save going through the whole gov.uk website, I'm hopeing that we're starting to beat this virus
          now and that soon it will no longer be needed. My other application is Football Hub, which is a similar application utilising a 3rd party API to access data on football. I created this
          little application for my step-son as he's football mad (personally I can't stand it), it's currently not finished, but as the football season has been put on hold, I don't think that matters
          too much. I'll come back to it eventually, but you can still explore it and make use of the functioning parts.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Well, I think I'll make that it for today, please stay tuned for my next issue, where I'll explain more about how I came to be a software/web developer. See you soon!
