          <h4>5 October 2020 - Apprenticeships</h4>
          I want to just put in a quick line about the importance of donating blood. I used to regularly donate, and was
          very proud to have hit my 10th pint. Due to some changes in my work life, I ended up missing a few donations,
          and then never really got back into it, I could have easily have hit 20 or maybe even 30 pints by now. The reason
          I want to tell you a little bit about this now, is that since Wednesday, I have received 10 units of blood to
          keep me alive. I've had not accident, I'm not bleeding, but without these transfusions, I wouldn't be able to
          type this. It never occurred to me that one person might need such a vast quantity of blood in such a short time,
          I still don't know the cause; however, my immune system is attacking my red blood cells faster than I can make
          them, and until this stops, I'm relying on transfusions to live. I'm now not allowed to donate blood having
          received it, but I want to encourage anyone reading this to consider donating, it's only a couple of hours
          out of your life per year.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now, let's talk about something a bit cheerier, shall we?
          <br/>
          Apprenticeships, apprenticeships. I am now convinced that this is one of the best ways to get into a specialist
          field such as software development, especially if you're not fresh out of university. It gives you the opportunity
          to get real world experience, which gives you the edge over graduates who only have certificates. There are pro's
          and con's, such as by studying with a university, you are more likely to learn the latest technologies, however,
          in an apprenticeship role, you will be learning the technologies that you'll actually be using for your job, even
          if they are a little outdated. Whilst a lower rate, an apprenticeship also allows you to be earning while you
          study, rather than ending up with a typical student debt. What I will say, and this is based on my experience
          with a single learning provider, is that it would seem that apprenticeships are less well regulated and seem
          to be less efficient when it comes to getting courses and exams organised and delivered.
          <br/>
          In the world of code, most apprenticeships seem to be covered by the same exams, but the learning material will
          vary wildly depending on what your job role will actually be. I'm going to tell you about mine, but I may
          cover a few other avenues along the way, to be fair, many of them cross over, especially if you are what is
          referred to as "full stack" (more on this later). I like to be given a problem or task, and then for me the
          thrill is to find the best solution. I'm not artistically creative, so I'd rather make something work well
          rather than make something look pretty, someone else can do that. I would say that I'm typically a
          back-end developer, being that I will work with data, and business logic to make applications that work,
          a front-end developer is more focussed on the user experience, such as web design or menu screens. I consider
          myself to be full-stack, because whilst they're not pretty, I have created my own user interfaces for the
          applications I have created. Coding jobs generally seem to boil down to web development (front end) and
          software developer (back end) jobs. You'll need to think about what's right for you, and what you enjoy, do
          you like problem solving, or do you prefer visual creativity? I'll come back tomorrow and tell you about where
          I started. TTFN.

          <h4>4 October 2020 - Sorry it's been a while</h4>
          Hello again campers, I've probably already lost all of your attention already, for that I apologise. Between
          a baby, an apprenticeship, a redundancy, new job and a stay in hospital I'm afraid this blog has been somewhat
          neglected during lockdown.
          <br/>
          I want to start at the beginning, as this was the purpose of this blog, but I think I owe you a brief explanation
          of where I am right now. During the lockdown I was placed of furlough at the very end of my apprenticeship, and
          then made redundant. My management team have been very supportive and I have managed to complete my studies
          and am just waiting for a final interview before my certificate is released. I have now found a new job with
          the local fire service, however a few days ago I collapsed, and have been in hospital ever since. This is a
          massive blow and couldn't have come at a worse time. I'm hoping to use some of my time in hospital to bring
          you all up to speed on my journey this far, as I'm really not up to doing much else.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I want to quickly touch on the web apps that I mentioned in my previous blog. I haven't made any changes since
          releasing these as I've been working on a much more interesting project, which I will show you in due course.
          however, I need to point out that the third-party data source as ceased working correctly and as a result I no
          longer receive the required data to show all the figures on screen. The NHS have now released their own API,
          so I will at some point go back and make the relevant changes, as it's becoming clear that COVID isn't going
          away any time soon.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          That's all for today, but I'll be back tomorrow.

          <h4>9 June 2020 - Welcome to Adsy's Corner</h4>
          Hi and welcome to the first issue of my blog. I’m a software developer at the end of my apprenticeship, and I thought that I might share my story as it's been quite interesting.
          I hope that it will provide some visibility into getting into code, and possibly help those that are thinking about making the first few steps.
          I built this website to help me practise my web building, and as I get time (once my apprenticeship is over) I may even make some applications that require Java and
          databases to practise my other software development skills. At the time of this issue, the website currently hosts 2 web applications. COVID19, which is a complete application that
          receives daily case and death data for the coronavirus and displays it in a basic dashboard to save going through the whole gov.uk website, I'm hoping that we're starting to beat this virus
          now and that soon it will no longer be needed. My other application is Football Hub, which is a similar application utilising a 3rd party API to access data on football. I created this
          little application for my step-son as he's football mad (personally I can't stand it), it's currently not finished, but as the football season has been put on hold, I don't think that matters
          too much. I'll come back to it eventually, but you can still explore it and make use of the functioning parts.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Well, I think I'll make that it for today, please stay tuned for my next issue, where I'll explain more about how I came to be a software/web developer. See you soon!
