          Any donations made to this site will be used to add new or imporve exisiting features of this site.
          Without donations, I can only use free public API's which usually have limited functionality, or a
          usage limit meaning that the applications can only deal with one user at a time, or can only be used by
          a certain number of users per day/week. Any donations will first be used to subscribe to paid versions
          so that more people can benefit from my work.
          &nbsb;Once the existing applications have funding, then I will look at ading more applications as I will be able to
          subscribe to more information. Any extra may go towards helping me learn more code or buy better equipment,
          which will mean better and more content!
        </p>
