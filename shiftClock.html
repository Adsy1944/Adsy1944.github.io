                    I was recently trying to think of some basic projects I could do, that I could possibly add to my apprenticeship portfolio to demonstrate my knowledge of building web applications,
                     I remembered that a colleague of mine at my previous job had created an excellent spreadsheet that could countdown until the end of the working day.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     I thought that this would be a great idea to try and replicate, and by adding inputs, a user could tailor the countdown to their own individual shift. Once I have a basic uer interface
                      set up, I'll start adding it here with warnings to advise what will and won't work. Once It's working, I'll send it to my old colleagues for a bit of fun!
